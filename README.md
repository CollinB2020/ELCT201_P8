# Microcontroller Pong Game (ELCT201 Final Project)

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a microcontroller-based implementation of the classic Pong game. This system implements a 32x64 RGB LED matrix with a 1:16 scan rate. Multithreading is used to calculate ball and paddle movements without disrupting the scan frequency of the LED matrix.
